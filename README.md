# Bloons TD 6 with AutoHotkey v2  

AutoHotkey 2 script for Bloons TD 6 to help during collection events. Plays through Expert, Easy, Standard maps with the collection bonus active.
The script will run continuously until a level up. If you level up, you will need to manually restart the script as it will break and get stuck.

The bot can be used in any farming event by simply changing the images contained in the "res" folder.

### Script status  
- __Experimental__: Might work sometimes but definitely not always  
- __Unstable__: Will work most of the time but does require assistance to recover 
- __Stable__: May not be perfect but will almost always recover without assistance  

## AutoHotkey v2

- [Documentation](https://lexikos.github.io/v2/docs/AutoHotkey.htm)

## Requirements:
- Full monkey knowledge. (You don't actually need all, but I programmed it with all knowledge on.)
- Benjamin Hero selected
- All expert maps unlocked. (Not sure on this one, but better safe than sorry.)
- Game running fullscreen on an 1920x1080 display. (Changing the resolution on a higher resolution display might work)
- the game must be at 60 fps or it may affect performance
- the cursor size should be at the smallest size
- graphics card settings can affect script performance, make sure you don't have any color modifiers in graphics settings

## Usage
Start the script on the home menu, stage selection menu, collection menu, or in an expert easy/standard map, using hot key Ctrl+Alt+Shift+J.

The script can be stopped by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P.  

you can change the speed of the script performance simply by changing the default number "1.00" until it suits your pc (on older computers 1.20 may be the correct speed).

```bash
  ; Config
global timeScale := 1.20	; Default 1.00, higher value = slower script
```
