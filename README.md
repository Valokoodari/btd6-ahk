# Bloons TD 6 with AutoHotkey v2  
![Logo](https://i.imgur.com/TeBO6q1.png)
AutoHotkey 2 script for Bloons TD 6 to help during collection events. Plays through Expert, Easy, Standard maps with the collection bonus active.
The script will run continuously until a level up. If you level up, you will need to manually restart the script as it will break and get stuck.

### Script status  
- __Experimental__: Might work sometimes but definitely not always  
- __Unstable__: Will work most of the time but does require assistance to recover  
- __Stable__: May not be perfect but will almost always recover without assistance  

## AutoHotkey v2

## Requirements:
- Full monkey knowledge. (You don't actually need all, but I programmed it with all knowledge on.)
- Benjamin Hero selected
- All expert maps unlocked. (Not sure on this one, but better safe than sorry.)
- Game running fullscreen on an 1920x1080 display. (Changing the resolution on a higher resolution display might work)

The script can be stopped by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P.
