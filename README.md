An AutoHotkey v2 script for Bloons TD 6 to help during collection events. Plays through expert maps
on easy, standard difficulty with the collection bonus active or Dark Castle when no collection
event is active.  

The most likely reason for the script to break and get stuck is a level up. In most cases even this
should only result as a single defeat but you may need to finish the current game and restart the
script manually.
